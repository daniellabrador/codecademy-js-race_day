## Project Prompt

Codecademy’s annual race is just around the corner! This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.

As a timeline, registration would look like this:

![registration-timeline](./resources/img/raceday-timeline.svg)

Here’s how our registration works. There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age). They can register early or late. Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.

Race number:

- Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.
- All others receive a number below 1000.

Start time:

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.

- Early adults run at 9:30 am.
- Late adults run at 11:00 am.
- Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).

## Technologies
